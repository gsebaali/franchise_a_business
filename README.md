# franchise_a_business


__Problem:__ 
There are a lot of factors that can contribute to whether to open a franchise in a neighborhood or not. These factors include demographic (such as size of population, household breakdown etc.), socioeconomic (age range, gender, preferences) and geographical factors [2].

This report focusses on helping business owners identify the neighborhood where to open a Trader Joe's, an American chain of grocery stores headquartered in Monrovia, California. The report specifically studies geographical locations in California to assess how likely is a certain location with no Trader Joes to be a good investment to open one. A prediction is then made on the city of Toronto to assess the likelihood of each neighborhood being good location for opening a Trader Joe's store.

This project aims to predict the probability of a certain geographical location that doesnt have a local Trader Joe’s to be a likely Trader Joe’s location.A machine learning model is trained to be able to evaluate a location and to make a prediction for potential new locations for Trader Joe's.
